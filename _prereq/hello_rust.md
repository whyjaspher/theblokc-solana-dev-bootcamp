# BOOTCAMP SESSION: FAMILIARIZE WITH RUST

Launched git-bash to initialize rust and launched vscode using it to edit the rust program.

Since I'm not really familiar with the syntax // commands, I just followed what the video said and did.

I was able to recreate the activity and now I'm currently trying to understand it.
